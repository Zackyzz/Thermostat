A thermostat ensures that the temperature in a room is between a min and max adjustable temperature. It assumes that a sensor provides at each time-step the temperature.
In case the temperature is lower than the minimum or higher than the maximum allowed, then the thermostat starts heating, or respectively, starts cooling the room up to a mean temperature (an average between min and max).
